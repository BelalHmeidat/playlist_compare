## Dumb Apple Music - Spotify playlist comparer script. Idea is to find songs unique to each platform and not ending up with tons of duplicates as is the case using apps like _Soundiiz_ to do so.

Dependencies:
- pandas
- plistlib

Apple music file needs to be exported as .xml file. Spotfity needs to be exported as .csv using apps like _Soundiiz_ and _Tune My Music_.


Ways to improve (might do but not promised):
- Support for more file types
- Songs similarity ratio
- Direct API connection
- GUI
- Binary packages
- Automatically adding new songs to account
